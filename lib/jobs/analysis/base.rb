module Jobs
  
  # Module containing all analysis jobs
  module Analysis
    
    # Base class for all analysis jobs
    #
    # All jobs act on a dataset with a user ID, so those are common to all
    # analysis jobs.  Also, we include some error handling code (via Airbrake).
    #
    # Analysis jobs are required to implement one view, and possibly a second,
    # located at +lib/jobs/analysis/views/(job)/*.html.haml+:
    #
    # - +start.html.haml+: This contains code for starting a job.  It will be
    #   placed inside a <ul> tag, and so should contain at least one list
    #   item.  Commonly, it will contain (i) a single list item for
    #   starting the job, (ii) multiple <li> tags for different ways of
    #   starting the job, or (iii) a nested <ul> that contains different
    #   ways of starting the job (which will be handled gracefully by 
    #   jQuery Mobile).  Note that this should have at least one link to the
    #   appropriate invocation of +datasets#task_start+ to be useful.
    # - +results.html.haml+ (optional): Tasks may report their results in two
    #   different ways.  Some tasks (e.g., ExportCitations) just dump all of
    #   their results into a file (see +AnalysisTask#result_file+) for the
    #   user to download.  This is the default, for which +#download?+ returns
    #   +true+.  If +#download?+ is overridden to return +false+, then the
    #   job is expected to implement the +results+ view, which will show the
    #   user the results of the job in HTML form.  The standard way to do this
    #   is to write the job results out as YAML in +AnalysisTask#result_file+,
    #   and then to parse this YAML into HAML in the view.
    class Base < Jobs::Base
      # @return [String] the user that created this dataset
      attr_accessor :user_id
      # @return [String] the dataset to export
      attr_accessor :dataset_id
      
      # True if this job produces a download
      #
      # If true (default), then links to results of tasks will produce links to
      # download the result_file from that task.  If not, then the link to the
      # task results will point to the 'results' view for this job.  Override
      # this method to return false if you want to use the 'results' view.
      #
      # @api public
      # @return [Boolean] true if task produces a download, false otherwise

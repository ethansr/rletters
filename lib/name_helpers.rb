  # Turn an author's name into a set of Lucene queries
  #
  # When a user searches for an author by name, we want some degree of
  # fuzziness in our search results.  This function calls 
  # +NameHelpers.query_for_names+ with (1) just the first and last name, and
  # (2) the first, middle (if provided), and last names.  It also takes into
  # account the possiblity of the user providing a compact string of initials.
  #
  # @api public
  # @param [String] a the name to split
  # @return [String] the Lucene query for this author name
  # @example Add a Lucene query for W. Shatner
  #   params[:q] += "authors:(#{name_to_lucene('W. Shatner')})"

  # Create Lucene queries for the given names
  #
  # This function handles the vagaries of the formatting of an individual set
  # of names for Lucene.  There are three basic processes that this function
  # performs:
  #
  # 1. If a name is submitted by the user as a single letter, it will be 
  #    searched with a wildcard.
  # 2. If a name is submitted by the user *not* as a single letter, it will
  #    result in two queries, one with the full name and one with an initial.
  # 3. If multiple initials in a row are present, then we combine them into
  #    a single search term.

  #   #=> ['"F Last"', '"First Last"']
  # @example Query with wildcards

  #   #=> ['"F* Last"']
